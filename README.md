## Project Insights & Objectives
This project aims to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for ride bookings, cancellations, customer behavior, and revenue trends using SQL and Power BI. By examining booking success rates, ride distances, cancellation reasons, and payment methods, we can identify operational bottlenecks and customer preferences. The analysis of driver and customer ratings across vehicle types helps enhance service quality.

Power BI visualizations will provide insights into ride volume trends, revenue distribution, and rating patterns, helping decision-makers optimize driver performance, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue. Understanding ride cancellations and booking values will further assist in strategic planning for better service efficiency.
